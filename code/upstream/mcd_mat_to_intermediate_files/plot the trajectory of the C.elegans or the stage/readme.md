Functions of these codes

* plot the whole C.elegans in the relative frame.
* plot the trajectory of the stage in the absolute frame.
* plot the trajectory of the C.elegans in the absolute frame.

The goal of these codes

* check if the mcd_corrected.mat is right
  * First, for the mcd.SegmentedCenterline, the y-axis is reversed.
  * Second, for the mcd.StagePosition, the x-axis is reversed.

* check the ideal direction of your mcd_corrected.mat file with the experimental record.
