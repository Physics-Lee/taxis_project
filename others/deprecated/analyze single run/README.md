# Introduction

These codes were written in the March and April of 2023.

I wanted to analyze some indexes for each run at that time, but lately I found that taking all the subsets (and keep the time order) is a better approach.



# THINK

Now (2023-09-29) consider about it, I believe that

* $v$ is suitable for both approaches.
* Indexes not involving information from the outside is suitable for both approaches. (The latter approach is better.)
* Indexes involving information from the outside is not suitable for the latter approach. 

This is my intuition and I can't explain it in rigorous words now.
