# Introduction

Hi, I am a ranger in neuroscience.

For the taxis project, we have found that

* reorientation strategy
  * Poisson Process
  * Biased random walk type I: **a strange peak**
  * Biased random walk type II
* run strategy: **more straight**



# How to Analyze?

Now we have data from both the high-throughout system and the Colbert system, so it is better to save some halfway files.

Just 2 steps. **(I will call the first step upstream and call the second step downstream.)**

For the high-throughout system:

`eset.mat -> run_disp.mat et al. -> results`

For the Colbert system:

`mcd.mat, machine_label.csv -> run_disp.mat et al. -> results`
